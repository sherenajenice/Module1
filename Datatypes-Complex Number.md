# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real part.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.

## 💻 Program
a=int(input()) 

b=int(input()) 

x=complex(a,b) 

print(x) 

print(x.real)

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts is veerified.
